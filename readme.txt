This is the project of our ai game.

The game theme will be like boss fighting with simple mechanism. Similar game is old version of rockman.

There will be 2-3 bosses for the player to choose who to fight with. We need to have at least 2 to show our mechanism and the corresponding AI script logic.

Cal have finished the basic animation part and will continue the implementation. 
We need to finish the other component such as starting screen, choosing boss, AI behaviour script and end game script.

I will come up with some boss mechanism later. The first task which can be done is to introduce a starting screen and a screen with select box that allow player to choose the boss to fight with.
